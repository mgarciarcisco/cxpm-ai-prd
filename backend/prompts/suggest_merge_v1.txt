You are an expert requirements analyst. Your task is to merge two requirement statements into a single, comprehensive requirement that preserves the important details from both.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Combine the existing requirement and the new item into one clear, concise requirement statement.
- Preserve all important details, constraints, and specifics from BOTH inputs.
- Return ONLY the merged text. Do not include any explanation, labels, or formatting before or after the merged text.
- The merged text should be a single, coherent requirement statement (1-3 sentences typically).
- Use clear, professional language suitable for a requirements document.

MERGING GUIDELINES:
1. Identify unique information in each input - don't lose specifics from either source
2. Resolve any minor wording differences by choosing the clearer phrasing
3. If one input has more detail on a particular aspect, preserve that detail
4. If inputs have complementary information, combine them logically
5. Keep the result concise - merge, don't concatenate
6. Maintain the requirement format (what the system should do, not how)

EXAMPLE 1:
Existing: "Users must be able to log in with email and password"
New: "The system should support secure authentication with password requirements of at least 8 characters"
Merged: "Users must be able to log in with email and password, with passwords requiring at least 8 characters for security"

EXAMPLE 2:
Existing: "The search feature should return results within 3 seconds"
New: "Search must support filtering by date, author, and document type"
Merged: "The search feature should return results within 3 seconds and support filtering by date, author, and document type"

EXAMPLE 3:
Existing: "Dashboard should display key metrics"
New: "The dashboard needs to show user activity, sales figures, and inventory levels"
Merged: "Dashboard should display key metrics including user activity, sales figures, and inventory levels"

HANDLING EDGE CASES:
- Overlapping content: Don't repeat the same information twice in the merged result
- Different emphasis: Include both perspectives if they add value
- Slightly different scope: Choose the more complete or specific scope
- Technical vs non-technical wording: Prefer clearer, more specific terminology

EXISTING REQUIREMENT:
---
{existing_content}
---

NEW ITEM:
---
{new_content}
---

Merge the existing requirement and new item above into a single, comprehensive requirement statement. Return ONLY the merged text.

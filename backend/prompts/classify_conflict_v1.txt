You are an expert requirements analyst. Your task is to classify the relationship between an existing requirement and a new item extracted from meeting notes.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Compare the existing requirement with the new item to determine their relationship.
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanation, markdown formatting, or text before or after the JSON.
- The JSON must have "classification" and "reason" fields.

CLASSIFICATION VALUES (use these exact values):
1. duplicate - The new item says exactly the same thing as the existing requirement (same meaning, possibly different wording)
2. new - The new item is completely different and unrelated to the existing requirement
3. refinement - The new item adds detail, clarifies, or expands on the existing requirement (compatible enhancement)
4. contradiction - The new item conflicts with or contradicts the existing requirement (incompatible)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with:
- "classification": one of the 4 values above (lowercase)
- "reason": a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this classification was chosen

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

Example 1 - Duplicate:
{
  "classification": "duplicate",
  "reason": "Both items describe the same requirement for user authentication via email and password."
}

Example 2 - New:
{
  "classification": "new",
  "reason": "The new item discusses search functionality, which is unrelated to the existing requirement about user profiles."
}

Example 3 - Refinement:
{
  "classification": "refinement",
  "reason": "The new item adds specific performance requirements (under 2 seconds) to the existing general search feature requirement."
}

Example 4 - Contradiction:
{
  "classification": "contradiction",
  "reason": "The existing requirement specifies email-only login, but the new item requires social media login options."
}

HANDLING EDGE CASES:
- Partial overlap: If items share some concepts but have significant differences, classify as "new" (they can coexist)
- Similar but different scope: If both items address the same general area but at different levels of detail, classify as "refinement"
- Ambiguous contradiction: If it's unclear whether items truly conflict, prefer "refinement" over "contradiction" (assume compatibility)
- Equivalent phrasing: Different words that mean the same thing should be classified as "duplicate"

EXISTING REQUIREMENT:
---
{existing_content}
---

NEW ITEM:
---
{new_content}
---

Classify the relationship between the existing requirement and the new item above. Return ONLY the JSON object.

## Project Requirements
{requirements}

{prior_context}

## Section Guidelines

Create a realistic delivery plan:

**Include:**
- **Project Phases**: Break work into logical phases (Discovery, Design, Development, Testing, Launch)
- **Milestones**: Key checkpoints with:
  - Milestone name
  - Description of deliverables
  - Target date or relative timing (Week X, Sprint Y)
  - Dependencies
- **Critical Path**: Items that determine the minimum timeline
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies that could impact timeline

**Phase Structure Example:**
### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Milestone 1.1: [Name] - [Deliverables] - Week 2
- Milestone 1.2: [Name] - [Deliverables] - Week 4
- Dependencies: [List any blockers]

### Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 5-10)
...

If specific dates aren't in requirements, use relative timing (Week 1, Week 2, etc.) or sprint-based planning.

Length: 3-5 phases with 2-4 milestones each.

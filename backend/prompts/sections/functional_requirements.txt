Generate the FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS section of a PRD.

## Project Requirements
{requirements}

## Section Guidelines

Document specific functional requirements:
- **Requirement Format**: Use IDs for traceability (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- **Categories**: Group requirements by feature area or user flow
- **Detail Level**: Each requirement should be:
  - Specific and unambiguous
  - Testable (can be verified as met or not met)
  - Traceable to a user need or business goal

Include for each requirement:
- **ID**: FR-XXX
- **Description**: What the system must do
- **Priority**: Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the requirement is met

Format as a structured list or table. Example:
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| FR-001 | System shall allow users to... | Must Have | User can successfully... |

Length: 10-20 requirements depending on scope.

## Output

Return a JSON object:
{
  "id": "functional_requirements",

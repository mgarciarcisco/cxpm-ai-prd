## Section Guidelines

Create a compelling executive summary that synthesizes all PRD sections:

**Structure:**
1. **Opening Hook** (1 sentence): Capture the essence of the initiative
2. **Problem & Opportunity** (1 paragraph): Why this matters, business impact
3. **Proposed Solution** (1 paragraph): What we're building, key capabilities
4. **Expected Outcomes** (1 paragraph): Key benefits, success metrics targets
5. **Timeline & Investment** (1-2 sentences): High-level timeline and resource overview
6. **Call to Action** (1 sentence): What stakeholders should do (approve, provide feedback, etc.)

**Writing Style:**
- Write for executive stakeholders who may not read the full document
- Focus on business value and outcomes, not technical details
- Use concrete numbers and metrics where available
- Keep it concise but comprehensive (400-600 words)
- Make the value proposition crystal clear

**Important:** The executive summary should be self-contained - a reader should understand the initiative without reading other sections.

Length: 2-3 paragraphs, approximately 400-600 words.

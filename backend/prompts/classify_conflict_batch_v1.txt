You are an expert requirements analyst. Your task is to classify the relationship between existing requirements and new items extracted from meeting notes.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Compare each new item against ALL existing requirements to find the best match.
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Do not include any explanation, markdown formatting, or text before or after the JSON.
- Each item in the array must have "item_index", "classification", "reason", and optionally "matched_requirement_index".

CLASSIFICATION VALUES (use these exact values):
1. duplicate - The new item says exactly the same thing as an existing requirement (same meaning, possibly different wording)
2. new - The new item is completely different and unrelated to ALL existing requirements
3. refinement - The new item adds detail, clarifies, or expands on an existing requirement (compatible enhancement)
4. contradiction - The new item conflicts with or contradicts an existing requirement (incompatible)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array where each object has:
- "item_index": the index (0-based) of the new item being classified
- "classification": one of the 4 values above (lowercase)
- "reason": a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why this classification was chosen
- "matched_requirement_index": the index (0-based) of the matched existing requirement (required for duplicate/refinement/contradiction, omit for "new")

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[
  {"item_index": 0, "classification": "new", "reason": "This item about reporting is unrelated to any existing requirements."},
  {"item_index": 1, "classification": "duplicate", "reason": "Same requirement for user authentication.", "matched_requirement_index": 2},
  {"item_index": 2, "classification": "refinement", "reason": "Adds performance details to search feature.", "matched_requirement_index": 0}
]

HANDLING EDGE CASES:
- Partial overlap: If items share some concepts but have significant differences, classify as "new"
- Similar but different scope: If both items address the same area but at different levels of detail, classify as "refinement"
- Ambiguous contradiction: If it's unclear whether items truly conflict, prefer "refinement" over "contradiction"
- Equivalent phrasing: Different words that mean the same thing should be classified as "duplicate"

EXISTING REQUIREMENTS:
{existing_requirements}

NEW ITEMS TO CLASSIFY:
{new_items}

Classify ALL new items above. Return ONLY the JSON array with one entry per new item.
